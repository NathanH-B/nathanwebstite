Um, but when I went to California just hanging out with friends, like every day, I, you know, I just packed it, you know, like, cause I just want to hang out with every single person I could hang out with, like one group of friends. And then I came down with another and then like another and he's super jam packed. And it was really fun though. Like I felt like I got a lot done, you know, caught up with a lot of people and stuff. That was cool. And then the rest of the break I spent back in New York. My brother just recently moved, so I helped him like move, he moved to New York, uh, and stuff like that. And we hang out. And then I like hanging out with like some friends, like, you know, some old roommates from freshman year. We all just kinda stick together.
