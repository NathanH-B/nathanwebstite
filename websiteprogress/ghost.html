Um, but when I went to California just hanging out with friends, like every day, I, you know, I just packed it, you know, like, cause I just want to hang out with every single person I could hang out with, like one group of friends. And then I came down with another and then like another and he's super jam packed. And it was really fun though. Like I felt like I got a lot done, you know, caught up with a lot of people and stuff. That was cool. And then the rest of the break I spent back in New York. My brother just recently moved, so I helped him like move, he moved to New York, uh, and stuff like that. And we hang out. And then I like hanging out with like some friends, like, you know, some old roommates from freshman year. We all just kinda stick together. And then just my roommate bought, got back and then we had just been hanging out. Um, but yeah, that's what I did too. That's part of California, San Francisco. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
